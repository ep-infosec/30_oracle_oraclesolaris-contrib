# Oracle Solaris Contributions 

## Summary:

The Oracle Solaris 11.4 Operating System brought with it the Solaris Analytics Dashboard, a WebUI interface and additional capabilities to observe and interact with the operating system. This repo contains information on the StatsStore, ways to access it, building custom sheets from the StatsStore data, capturing and retrieving this data for use with 3rd party applications and using the REST interface to interact with the Oracle Solaris OS.

Additionally, this repository also includes demos to augment the Oracle Solaris blog while giving an in-depth walkthrough about the features Oracle SPARC and Oracle Solaris has to offer like Database in Memory on SPARC and Deploying FOSS packages on demand. Along with these directories, there are markdowns specific to creating custom templates, important collateral documents, links to blogs as well as a collection of all the resources where you can deep dive into the various features of the Oracle Solaris 11.4 OS and the analytics dashboard.
