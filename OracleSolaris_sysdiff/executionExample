This file presents an example of the sysdiff execution against a solaris 10
branded zone.

Please review and adjust it as needed before running the next step.

Please provide the following directory as results-dir for the next steps:

/var/tmp/s10clean-CPU-mc-20210319142906

The next step should be 'sysdiff depresolve'
# sysdiff.py -q depresolve /var/tmp/s10clean-CPU-mc-20210319142906
'sysdiff depresolve' successful, next step is 'sysdiff lint'

! If the 'sysdiff lint' returns an error, it needs to be analyzed and addressed
! before continuing. In this case the issue is that the directory we're trying
! to package has different group than on Solaris 11.4 - root instead of other.
! the issue can be fixed either via removal of the problematic entry from
! the manifest, or by changing the group entry in the manifest to match the OS.
! Whenever the package attempts to deliver files to OS-delivered directories,
! it is recommended to review them carefully to avoid conflicts with OS
! delivered contents in the future.
! The warning can be ignored, or addressed by providing extended description
! for the package.
! Once the manifest is adjusted, the process needs to be restarted from the
! 'sysdiff depresolve' in case the change affected the dependencies of the
! package we're trying to generate.

Once the package is installed in the target zone, it may happen that one of
the packages it depends on becomes obsolete in the Solaris 11.4, which will
cause the OS update to fail, e.g.:
# pkg update --accept --be-name st_103 entire@11.4-11.4.39.0.0.103
...
A 'sync-linked' operation failed for child 'zone:targetzone' with an unexpected
return value of 1 and generated the following output:

pkg sync-linked: Package 's10clean-CPU-mc' must be uninstalled or upgraded if the requested operation is to be performed.
  Reject:  pkg://sysdiff-publisher/s10clean-CPU-mc@1.0
  Reason:  All acceptable versions of 'require-any' dependencies on frozenset({'runtime/perl-526@5.26.3-11.4.33.0.0.91.0'}) are obsolete

There are two possible approaches to addressing this issue. In the short term,
the obsoleted package may be unlocked to allow it to remain installed after the
update:

# zlogin targetzone
# pkg change-facet facet.version-lock.runtime/perl-526=false

This approach may lead to further issues/conflicts in the future, and is
recommended only as a stop-gap solution.

Permanent solution to such an issue is to regenerate the package based on
the original solaris10 branded zone and the preserved 'results-dir'. The
package can be regenerated by running the 'depresolve', 'lint', and 'publish'
steps as during the original creation of the package. Please keep in mind
that the package is timestamped, so it is not necessary to change the version
number during the respin, the updated timestamp is sufficient to make the
package distinct.
