# Oracle Solaris 11.1 Security Lab

This lab was orignally created for a Hands on Lab at Oracle OpenWorld in 2012 by Glenn Faden. But even though it was originally built on Oracle Solaris 11.1 the methods used are still fully relevant and can be used on Oracle Solaris 11.4.

You can find Glenn's original blog about this Hands on Lab [here](https://blogs.oracle.com/solaris/oracle-solaris-111-security-lab-v2).
