# StatsStore Threshold Alerts

The Oracle Solaris Fault Management feature provides an architecture for building resilient error handlers, structured error telemetry, automated diagnostic software, response agents, and structured messaging. Many parts of the software stack participate in Fault Management, including the CPU, memory and I/O subsystems, Oracle Solaris ZFS, an increasing set of device drivers, and other management stacks. The Oracle Solaris Analytics dashboard enables users to monitor these Faults and Alerts both using the WebUI alerting pop-up as well as the graphical representations.

This [markdown](Blog_Supplements/Threshold_FMA_Alerts/StatsStore_threshold_alerts.md) document simulates an overload in ZFS pool capacity and walks you through the various pieces involved in setting threshold alerts and monitoring the results.
