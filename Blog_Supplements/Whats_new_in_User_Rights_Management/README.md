# What's new in User Rights Management

This lab was orignally created for a blog written by Glenn Faden in 2013. But even though it was originally built on Oracle Solaris 11.1 the methods used are still fully relevant and can be used on Oracle Solaris 11.4.

You can find Glenn's original blog [here](https://blogs.oracle.com/solaris//whats-new-in-user-rights-management-v2).
