# Analyzing the Zones Sheet 

With [SRU27](https://blogs.oracle.com/solaris/announcing-oracle-solaris-114-sru27) for Oracle Solaris 11.4, we introduced a new Zone Statistics sheet on the Oracle Solaris WebUI. This sheet provides users an insight into  the following:

- Zone Overview 
  - Zone State History (installed/running)
  - CPU Resource Utilization Per Zone
  - Virtual Memory Utilization Per Zone
- Zone Network Stats
  - Network Link Statistics Per Zone
- Zone Filesystems
  - File Systems Usage Per Zone

The [zones_sheet.md](zones_sheet.md) offers you a detailed walkthrough of how the Zones Sheet benefits users to keep track of their zones.
