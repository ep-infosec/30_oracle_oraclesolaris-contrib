# Launching an Oracle Solaris Instance on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute lets you provision and manage compute hosts, known as **instances** . You can launch instances as needed to meet your compute and application requirements. After you launch an instance, you can access it securely from your computer, restart it, attach and detach volumes, and terminate it when you're done with it. Any changes made to the instance's local drives are lost when you terminate it. Any saved changes to volumes attached to the instance are retained.

There are two ways you can launch an instance using the OCI BUI, called the OCI Console. The first is through the entry in the [*Marketplace*](Launch_through_Marketplace.md), the other is through the [*Instances* page](Launch_through_Instances.md) in the Compute section of the OCI Console. The two articles linked above will show you how to do this.
