# Creating custom statistic representations on the WebUI

## Introduction:

The Oracle Solaris Analytics Dashboard offers a variety of default sheets with ready to use visualizations of the most essential statistics for you to monitor system parameters and performance. Apart from these, the Oracle Solaris WebUI also enables you to tap into the `sstore` to create your own version of a sheet, with custom combinations of statistics, events and resource apart from system defaults.
