# Adding a sheet to the Oracle Solaris Analytics Dashboard 

The Oracle Solaris Analytics dashboard enables users to create custom sheets for monitoring and analyzing parameters ranging from performance as well as key StatsStore stats. Such custom sheets can be easily downloaded and shared amongst other users owing to the files being in a .json format. In order to add shared sheets to your personal dashboard, here are the steps:

- [Adding a sheet (.json file) via the Command Line Interface](add_shared_sheet.md)
- [Sample sheet with key StatsStore parameters](sample-sheet.json)
